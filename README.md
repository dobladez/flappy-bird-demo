## Live interactive coding Flappy Bird in ClojureScript

This is a fork of https://github.com/bhauman/flappy-bird-demo, with some
modifications to show off re-setting of the app state and other minor changes.

I used this for my "Simple. Clojure" presentation at Java Conf. 2014 @ Buenos Aires. Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/dobladez/simple-clojure-java-conf-buenos-aires-2014

To play and modify the code live:

* Install http://leiningen.org/
* Run: `lein figwheel` (might take several seconds the first time)
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:3449/index.html`
* You may now modify the code at  `src/flappy_bird_demo/core.cljs` with any text editor. When saved, the code will be updated live in the browser (no page reload needed).
